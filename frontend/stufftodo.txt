BUG :

- Build sync seems to create duplicate sometimes when saving same build ?

Finishers :

- Set up server hosting : Vercel -> Hetzner or OVH ?
- meta tags

- Add instructions: tooltips + tutorial (text and video ?)

- example saved searches + edit saved search name

- New theme

WIP :

- Add stat icons

- Add a way to scroll to the category item from pano (and reverse) 
- Scrolling on best items also scrolls on matching selected items category (?)

- Navigation bar on left

- Saved searches doesn't show on top of the view for smaller windows
  -> OR move it between weights and best items

- import from dofusDB - and more sites later ?
- Open item in dofusDB / dofusbook 

- Sort selected items by pano value
- Separate display Dofus and Trophy with bonus pano < 3

- filter build by name

NO :

- Option for free weight/min/max input ? Wouldn't be saved precisely in url. Ask community ?

- Add custom value to some items ? Maybe a multiplier or addition save in local storage

- Save saved searches for each build -> NO Instead filter by level and requirements to always show the bests at the top...

- No: Show indirect weights applied from derived stats (init, pods, ret pm.., tacle / lock, prospecting)
