Important :

- Set up server hosting : Vercel -> Hetzner or OVH ?
- meta tags

- Add instructions: tooltips + tutorial (text and video ?)

- Add stat icons

- Add a way to scroll to the category item from pano (and reverse) 
- Scrolling on best items also scrolls on matching selected items category (?)

- import from dofusDB - and more sites later ?

- Display subcategory
- Add item special description ? + Weapon damage ?

- Navigation bar on left

- Better hover stat display if too low and can't see all

- Improve best panos calculations ?
- Item value = 0 when it has a requirement incompatible with min stats... ?
- Don't include incompatible items when calculating pano value

- Sort selected items by pano value

Do later :

- example saved searches + edit saved search name

- New theme

NO :

- Associate build to saved searches. Instead filter by level and requirements to always show the bests at the top...

- Option for free weight/min/max input ? Wouldn't be saved precisely in url. Ask community ?

- No: Show indirect weights applied from derived stats (init, pods, ret pm.., tacle / lock, prospecting)
