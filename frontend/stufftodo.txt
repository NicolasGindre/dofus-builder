Important :

- Set up server hosting : Vercel -> Hetzner

- Add instructions: tooltips + tutorial (text and video ?)

- ? Add stat icons

- meta tags

- Add a way to scroll to the category item from pano (and reverse) 
- Scrolling on best items also scrolls on matching selected items category (?)

- import from/to dofusDB / and the other one

- Export as new search

Do later :

- example saved searches + edit saved search name

- ? Show indirect weights applied from derived stats (init, pods, ret pm.., tacle / lock, prospecting)

- ? NO Associate build to saved searches. Instead filter by level and requirements to always show the bests at the top...

- New theme
