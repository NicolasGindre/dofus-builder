Important :

- Set up server hosting : Vercel -> Hetzner

- Add instructions: tooltips + tutorial (text and video ?)

- ? Add stat icons

- meta tags

- Add a way to scroll to the category item from pano (and reverse) 
- Scrolling on best items also scrolls on matching selected items category (?)

Do later :

- Monroe show requirements in pano

- example saved searches + edit saved search name

- Highlight stat/requirement in red/orange if min stat is more than actual stat

- ? Show indirect weights applied from derived stats (init, pods, ret pm.., tacle / lock, prospecting)

- ? Associate build to array of saved searches

- import from/to dofusDB / and the other one
