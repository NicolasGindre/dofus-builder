Important :

- Set up server hosting : Vercel -> Hetzner

- Add instructions: tooltips + tutorial (text and video ?)

- Merge build requirements

- import/export build from/to dofusDB / and the other one

- meta tags

- Add a way to scroll to the category item from pano (and reverse) 
- Scrolling on best items also scrolls on matching selected items category (?)

- Only download every Wednesday/Tuesday from 4 am
- Refresh dofusDB database items every Wednesday/Tuesday from 4 am -> check minId is correct

- Associate build to array of saved searches

Do later :

- Monroe show requirements in pano

- example saved searches + edit saved search

- Highlight stat/requirement in red/orange if min stat is more than actual stat

- ? Add stat icons

- ? Show indirect weights applied from derived stats (init, pods, ret pm.., tacle / lock, prospecting)
