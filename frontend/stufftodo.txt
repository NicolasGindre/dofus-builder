BUG :

- Build sync seems to create duplicate sometimes when saving same build ?

- Chrome speed is inconsistent ?

Finishers :

NOTHING ???

WIP :

- Partition data from 2 categories when necessary
 - Use a queuing worker system to go through all combos

- Improve quick select strategy. Use combos max or % from best or diff from best.

- Add configure UI with:
 - Bonus pano minimum
 - Quick select options
 - Use GPU / CPU

Later Maybe :

- New theme

- example saved searches + edit saved search name

- import from dofusDB - and more sites later ?

- Show most common items from build results
- filter build by name
 - filter build by item ? By locked item ?

- Show items and pano affecting stat when hovering on stat

- Calculate offensive weights from spells
 => Or implement full solution that calculates final damage

- Skip impossible combinations early with bonus pano < 3
 - And min stats ? nah

NO :

- Automatic saved search save ?

- Add class selection for class specific items + export to dofusDB ?

- Open item in dofusDB / dofusbook : not sure is any use honestly and takes precious UI space

- Option for free weight/min/max input ? Wouldn't be saved precisely in url. Ask community ?

- Add custom value to some items ? Maybe a multiplier or addition save in local storage

- Save saved searches for each build -> NO Instead filter by level and requirements to always show the bests at the top...

- No: Show indirect weights applied from derived stats (init, pods, ret pm.., tacle / lock, prospecting)

- Refresh best items automatically on weight/min/max change ?

- Add panoply to list of things you can search for in "add item"
